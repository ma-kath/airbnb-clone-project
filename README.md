## Database Design
1. User Authentication
* Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/, /users/{name}/, /users/{address}/
2. Property Management
* Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/, /properties/{booking_id}/, /properties/{pro_address}/
3. Booking System
* Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/, /bookings/{booking_date}/, /bookings/{check_in}/, /bookings/{check_out}/
4. Payment Processing
* Endpoints: /payments/, /payments/{payment_id}/, /payments/{price}/, /payments/{payment_date}/, /payments/{}
5. Review System
* Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/, /reviews/{review_text}/, /reviews/{user_id}/, /reviews/{review_date}/
6. Database Optimizations
* Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
* Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.
