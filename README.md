* Front-end developer: Create the part of an application that users interact with, ensuring that an app offers an equally smooth experience to all—no matter the device, platform, or operational system.
* Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
* Test automation engineer: Designs a test automation ecosystem and rites and maintains test scripts for automated testing.
* Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
* DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
* QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

## Database Design
1. User Authentication
* Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/, /users/{name}/, /users/{address}/
2. Property Management
* Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/, /properties/{booking_id}/, /properties/{pro_address}/
3. Booking System
* Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/, /bookings/{booking_date}/, /bookings/{check_in}/, /bookings/{check_out}/
4. Payment Processing
* Endpoints: /payments/, /payments/{payment_id}/, /payments/{price}/, /payments/{payment_date}/, /payments/{}
5. Review System
* Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/, /reviews/{review_text}/, /reviews/{user_id}/, /reviews/{review_date}/
6. Database Optimizations
* Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
* Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

## Feature Breakdown
1. User Management
* Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
> This feature allows users to register, log in, and manage their personal profiles. It is crucial for personalizing the user experience and securing individual accounts within the system.
2. Property Management
* Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
> This enables users to create, update, view, and remove property listings. This feature forms the core of the platform, facilitating the display and organization of available properties for rent or sale.
3. Booking System
* Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
> This functionality allows users to make, modify, and oversee their bookings, including specifying check-in and check-out times. It is essential for managing the reservation process and ensuring a smooth experience for both property owners and renters.
4. Payment Processing
* Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
> This feature handles all financial transactions related to bookings. It is vital for secure and efficient monetary exchanges, ensuring that payments are processed correctly and reliably.
5. Review System
* Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.
> This allows users to post and manage reviews for properties. It contributes to building trust and transparency within the platform by providing valuable feedback for future users and property owners.

## API Security
Robust API security is paramount for the success and trustworthiness of this project. We will implement several key security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure the integrity of all transactions.

### Key Security Measures:
* **Authentication:** This involves verifying the identity of any user or system attempting to access the API. Methods such as token-based authentication (e.g., JWTs) will be used to ensure that only legitimate and identified entities can interact with the system. This prevents unauthorized access by ensuring that every request is made by a verified user or application.
* **Authorization:** Once authenticated, authorization determines what specific actions an authenticated user or system is allowed to perform. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) will be implemented to grant permissions based on predefined user roles (e.g., a "property owner" can manage their listings, while a "renter" can make bookings). This granular control ensures that users can only access and manipulate data relevant to their role, preventing privilege escalation and unauthorized data modification.
* **Rate Limiting:** This mechanism restricts the number of API requests a user or system can make within a specified timeframe. Rate limiting helps to prevent abuse, such as brute-force attacks on login endpoints or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that could overwhelm the system. By controlling the request volume, it maintains system stability and availability for all legitimate users.

### Cruciality of Security for Each Key Area:
* **Protecting User Data (User Management & Review System):** Security is critical for user data to maintain privacy and prevent identity theft. Compromised user profiles could lead to personal information being exposed or misused. Strong authentication and authorization ensure that only the user themselves, or authorized personnel, can access and modify their profile information, and that reviews are attributed correctly and cannot be tampered with by malicious actors.
* **Securing Payments (Payment Processing):** Payment processing involves highly sensitive financial information. Security measures like encryption (HTTPS/TLS) for data in transit, and potentially tokenization of card details, are crucial to prevent fraud, data breaches, and financial losses for both users and the platform. A breach in this area would severely damage trust and could lead to significant legal and financial repercussions.
* **Ensuring Data Integrity (Property Management & Booking System):** The integrity of property listings and booking details is essential for the smooth operation of the platform. If these areas are not secure, malicious actors could alter property prices, availability, or even booking details, leading to confusion, financial disputes, and a breakdown of trust. Authentication and authorization prevent unauthorized modifications, ensuring that property information and booking statuses are accurate and reliable.
